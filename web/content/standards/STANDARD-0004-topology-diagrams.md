## Purpose
Guidance for creating consistent topology diagrams used in labs and documentation. This page describes recommended tools, export formats and upload workflow.
## Tools and Formatting
Use draw.io (diagrams.net) to create topology diagrams; keep the editable source as a `.drawio` file and export final artwork as an optimized `.svg`. When exporting, use a dark appearance with background color `#1E293B` and add a 10px border to the canvas. Label every component clearly (use real device names where applicable) and prefer the Cisco icon set available in draw.io for network devices.
