## Purpose
A short, centralized explanation of why we maintain standards: to ensure clarity, consistency, and reusability across content, assets and collaboration workflows.

## What these standards cover
- **Naming Conventions** — rules for filenames and slugs to keep content searchable and URL-safe.
- **Asset Management** — where and how to store, version and reference diagrams, images and binaries.
- **Topology Diagrams** — recommended tools, export formats and visual style for network diagrams.
- **Content Structure** — recommended front matter and section layout for Labs, Theory, Blog posts and Projects.
- **Git Workflow** — branch, commit and PR conventions plus review guidance for safe, consistent changes.
