## About the Project
Labak is a student-driven initiative to create a dedicated space for learning, experimenting, and collaborating in the field of computer networking. The project combines hands-on infrastructure (physical and virtual networking devices) with a community-driven knowledge base where learners and contributors can design, share, and improve networking exercises.

The laboratory is designed to:

Provide access to diverse networking platforms beyond vendor-specific curricula.

Offer structured lab exercises with standardized topologies, configurations, and documentation.

Encourage collaboration through open contribution standards and version-controlled resources.

Serve as a long-term, evolving hub for networking enthusiasts within the school community.

By blending a practical lab environment with an open, collaborative platform, the project aims to make networking education more accessible, diverse, and community-oriented.
